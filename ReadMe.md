python3 sshsimplerserver.py and build necessary tools

## step1 know the twisted how to work
- the function is different between ssh and echo tcp. ***tcp is not use session and ssh must use session***.
- **how to use a diy nonblocking function is a second key point** now lets do some interesting.
- now wo can deal the multi thread problem and use deferToThread is a easy way
## step2 do a fake shell command (finish)
